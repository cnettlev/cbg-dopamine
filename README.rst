**Abstract** In a previous modeling study, Leblois et al. (2006) demonstrated
 an action selection mechanism in cortico-basal ganglia loops based on
 competition between the positive feedback, direct pathway through the striatum
 and the negative feedback, hyperdirect pathway through the subthalamic
 nucleus. The present study investigates how multiple level action selection
 could be performed by the basal ganglia. To do this, the model is extended in
 a manner consistent with known anatomy and electro-physiology in three main
 areas. First, two-level decision making has been incorporated, with a
 cognitive level selecting based on cue shape and a motor level selecting based
 on cue position. We show that the decision made at the cognitive level can be
 used to bias the decision at the motor level. We then demonstrate that, for
 accurate transmis- sion of information between decision-making levels, low
 excitability of striatal projection neurons is necessary, a generally observed
 electrophysiological finding. Second, instead of providing a biasing signal
 between cue choices as an external input to the network, we show that the
 action selection process can be driven by reasonable levels of noise. Finally,
 we incorporate dopamine modulated learning at corticostriatal synapses. As
 learning progresses, the action selection becomes based on learned visual cue
 values and is not interfered with by the noise that was necessary before
 learning.
